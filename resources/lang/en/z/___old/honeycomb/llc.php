This allows us carry out a full range of experiments and tests using our equipment to ensure its quality and efficiency.',
    'text_p_1' => 'SensitivE Audit concept of operation is based on the methods of <a class="-grey vol-1" href=""><span>frequency-wave imprinting</span></a> and <a class="-grey vol-1" href=""><span>biomagnetic resonance</span></a>. The methodologies fall back on the theory of electromagnetic fields in living organisms. Any cell is argued to create an individual electromagnetic field around itself with its specific oscillation frequency. All the foreign processes in the body, allergy pathogens and toxic substances create oscillations with their our spectrum. ',
    'text_p_2' => 'Under their influence, the harmony of the field of healthy cells is disturbed with a frequency change. The frequency shift magnitude directly depends on the depth of malignant changes and biosystem imbalance at the time of the study. The imprinting mechanism quickly captures changes and fixes them at the cellular level, despite their being pathologic and even harmful.',
